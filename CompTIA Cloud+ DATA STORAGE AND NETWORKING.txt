These are my notes from when I did my course on CompTIA Cloud+ through alison.com

I hope these help you through your course. :)

DISK TYPES AND CONFIGURATIONS

Storage devices serve as the foundation of a storage network this is also a foundation of a cloud network.
Disk performance is a key factor to the overall health of your cloud environment.
Various types and configurations exist and characteristics must be understood. 

Disk drive technology has advanced in significant ways and choosing the right disk type is important. 
	* Size of Disk.
	* Purpose of the disk.
	* Evaluation of the business requirements.

The term disk storage is generic and describes several different storage mechanisms storing data in different ways. 
	* Electronic
	* Magnetic
	* Optical
	* Mechanical
Disk storage refers to a permanent type of storage where data is retained even when power is lost.
	
	Memory is referred as Primary Storage.
	Disk storage is referred as Secondary Storage.

A Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is a mechanical drive with specific characteristics.
	* Individual platters coated in magnetic material.
	* Read/Write heads hover over the surface to R/W data in specific areas.
	* Drive density determines the amount of data stored.
	* RPM determines the speed of access.
This still remains the dominate secondary storage medium.

INTERFACE TYPES

Advances Technology Attachment 		(ATA)
Parallel Advances Technology Attachment 	(PATA)
Integrated Drive Electronics 			(IDE)
Serial Advances Technology Attachment		(SATA)
Small Computer System Interface 		(SCSI)
Serial Attached SCSI				(SAS)


Access Speed
A critical components to understanding disk interfaces.
The speed that a disk can access data is critical to performance. 
This includes two main components. 
	* Seek Time - The measure of how long it takes to find data.
	* Latency - The measure of time delay it takes to properly position the read/write heads.

Solid State Drive (SSD)

High performance drives with no moving parts. 
This is available in two types.
	* Dynamic Ram "Used to have alternative power source"
	* Flash Memory (vast majority today)
Includes its own CPU and memory bus thus resulting in higher speeds. 
Same I/O interfaces as mechanical drives with significant advantages.
	* Faster access time & lower latency.
	* Less susceptible to being dropped.
	* Fast start-up time & less power consumption.
	* Less risk of data loss.
Disadvantages
	* Cost.

USB
An External connection that support plug and play.
Its highly portable.

Tape
Storage that reads and writes data to a magnetic tape. 
Provides sequential data access.
Primarily used for high volume low speed backups.

Tiering
Provides the ability to adjust the location of data based on performance and availability.
Data can be moved from one tier automatically based on requirements. 


Tier 1.
	Mission Critical data.
	Highly secure.
	Recently accessed 
	Recommended to use Raid with Parity. 

Tier 2.
	Data that runs major business applications
	e.g. Emails Databases, ERP systems. 
	Requires fast but not immediate response times. 

Tier 3.
	Includes archived data that must be kept but not accessed on a daily basis.

Tier 4.
	Used for compliance requirements, long term storage of email data large amount of data that does not need to be immediately access.  


RAID 

Disk Mirror - RAID 1 
	Logical volume is created with two physical disks of the same size. Data is written directly to both disks.
	Features good read / write performance, is able to sustain a single drive failure. 
	Provides 50% compacity of the disk.
	Raid 1 is primarily used for OS Drives e.g. C:\

Disk Striping - Raid 0
	Multiple disk collected into a single logical volume, data is striped across the physical disks in 64kb stripes.
	No redundancy is provided. used to achieve high level of performance. 

Raid 1+0 (10) 
	A Hybrid arrangement consisting of a top level raid 0 that is composed of two or more raid 1 arrays.
	Can sustain multiple drive failures. If a drive fails it will lower the mirror array into a Degraded state, but this will function as normal. 

Raid 0+1 
	Same as Raid 10 but the other way round, longer recovery periods due to the need to rebuild stripe sets. It is a less common of the hybrid raid. 

Striped set with Parity - Raid 5
	Combines multiple drives at least 3 into a logical drive. Great balance of data protection, performance and cost effectiveness.
	Able to sustain a single drive failure, 
Raid 6 - double parity
	Allows for multiple drive failures, lowers the performance, ideal for situations where additional failover tolerance is required.

File Systems 
	A file system is responsible for various aspects of storage.
	* Storing and updating files, retrieving files. 
	* Managing and accessing metadata
	* Managing disk space. 
	
Unix File System (UFS)
	Primary file systems for Unix using hierarchical file system structure, the highest level is root. 
	All files are related to one and other in parent child relationships and additional directories are called sub directories. 

File Allocation Table (FAT)
	Legacy file system providing good performance does not provide reliability and scalability of newer file systems. Supports variety of removable media types. 

New Technology File System (NTFS)
	Proprietary file system developed by Microsoft, introduced in the 90s with WindowsNT provides numerous advantages over Fat32.
	* Compression 	* Shadow Copies
	* Disk Quotas	* Local Security & Encryption.

Virtual Machine File System (VMFS)
	VMware Cluster system, used with ESX and VMSphere Servers. Provides the ability for multiple servers to read and write data from the drive simultaneously. 
	Keeps individual VM files locked for one host server. Multiple volumes can be spanned logically increasing space.

Z File System. 
	Its a combined file system and logical volume manager developed by sun microsystems, it provides high storage 	capabilities and protection against data corruption. 
	Created with data integrity as its primary focus. Only 128-bit file system using polled storage. 

Storage Technologies
	Direct Attached Storage - DAS
	Most common type of storage including disks physically attached to a certain server. 
	Used in small or single server environments. 
	Available in block and file level access. 
	It is not scalable as storage is not accessible by multiple servers.

Network Attached Storage - NAS
	Provides network based shared storage in a cost effective manner.
		* Uses file level access protocols

Storage Area Network - (SAN)
	High Performance Storage Solution used in a majority of data centres and cloud environments. 
	* Highly Scalable 	* Highly Available 	* Accessible to multiple servers.
	
	A storage device residing on its own private storage network. Its provides block level access to use as storage for clients. 
	Disks on a SAN appear to clients as a disk drive identified by a logical drive unit number (LUN)
	Additional adapters are required in order to access the SAN.
		* Known as HBA Host Bus Adapters. * Virtual HBA
	Each HBA hosts a unique identifier known as World Wide Number (WWN) 
		* 8 byte number, node wwn, port wwn. 

Access Methods

	Fibre Chanel (FC)
	Technology for transmitting storage up to 10Gbps.
	Components consist of SAN, Physical or Virtual system containing HBA card, Fibre Channel Switches.
	
	Fibre Chanel other Ethernet 
	Provides the benefits of fibre channel in a more cost effective manner. 

	Fibre Chanel will only be deployed if high speeds are seriously necessary. 

	Topology Layouts 
	* Arbitrated Loop
	* Point to Point
	* Switch Fabric.
		
ISCSI (Internet SCSI)
	Typically relies on a typical standard ethernet network architecture. 
	Uses TCP/IP and TCP Port 3260 to communicate.
	
	IP network ISCSI target servers that run on the storage device ISCSI initiator (Client) - software or Host adapter that provides access to targets
	ISCSI IQN - Globally unique identifier used to address initiators and target on ISCSI network. 
	ISCSI supports access to SCSI based storage.
