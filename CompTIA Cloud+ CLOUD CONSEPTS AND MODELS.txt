These are my notes from when I did my course on CompTIA Cloud+ through alison.com

I hope these help you through your course. :)

Cloud Benefits 

Virtualization.
	* Reduces foot print thus reducing energy to power equipment. 
	* Enables you to grow when needed to. 
	* Pay as you go ( grow )

Problems with server based infrastructure.
	* Physical hardware is required. 
	* Individual Roles on servers will mean separate servers  e.g. Not best practice to install IIS on a DC. 
	* Underused Servers. 
	* Data is stored locally. 

Advantages.
	* Virtual Data centre. 
	* Reduction in cost.
	* Self service provisioning.
	* Increase energy consciousness. 
	* Improved resiliency.


IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service. 

	Cloud consumers outsources responsibility for the infrastructure to the cloud provider. This is usually used by IT Services.
	Cloud Providers handles Storage, Computing power and connectivity domains. 
	This provides loads of advantages
	* Pay as you Go.
	* Control over applications & operating systems. 
	* Quickly scalable. 


PaaS - Platform as a Service. 
	Enable Customers to deploy applications without requiring the expense of the infrastructure. 
	Customers purchase or create applications of the internet. This is often used by Developers. 

SaaS - Software as a Service. 
	Consumers take advantage of software delivery using the internet. It is an efficient way to deploy a line of business applications.
	e.g. Office Productivity, Team Collab/ communications and Project Management. 
	This is mainly used by end users. 

DBaaS - DataBase as a Service. 
	A form of software specializing in the automatic deliver of operations. 
	several competencies are supported. 
	* Self service provisioning of DataBase instances.
	* Monitoring of DataBase attributes at QOS level. 
	* Measured usage of DataBase.
	* Additional Capabilities. 
	* Service Multitenancy. 
	* Service Elasticity.

CaaS - Communications as a Service. 

	Examples of these are VoIP, instant messaging and Audio video conferencing. 

BPaaS 
	This is generally Monitoring, I didn’t pay much attention on this bit as its rarely used. 

XaaS - IT as a Service.
	Delivery of IT as a Service through Hybrid cloud computing. Distribution of different IT Components in the cloud. 

Accountability.

	SaaS - Cloud Provider assumes responsibilty 
	IaaS / PaaS - responsibility is distributed between consumer and the provider.


PRIVATE CLOUD
	Cloud delivery model owned by a single organization. It is implemented locally using privately owned resources. 
	Its incorporated behind the firewall and maintained by the local IT Dept. 
	
Advantages 
	* Maintain Control of the environment. 
	* Scalability and Flexibility. 
	* Auto Provisioning. ( pay for what you need)
Disadvantages 
	* Does not provide ROI like other delivery methods. 
	* Required additional administrative overheads. 

PUBLIC CLOUD
	Its a pool of computing resources that is owned and managed by a service provider. 
	Its offer Pay As You Go model which provides scalability and attitional options. e.g. Azure, AWS, HP Cloud...

Advantages 
	* Easy and inexpensive setup.
	* You get for what you pay for, with grow capabilities. 
	* Available to all organizations.
Disadvantages 
	* Security options might not be robust enough for all your data. 
	* Lack of customization and admin access. 


HYBRID CLOUD
	Utilizes both Public and Private Cloud to handle distant functions for the organization. It involves two environments being setup.
	Using multiple SaaS applictions sends data to private cloud. 

COMMUNITY CLOUD
	Infrastructures shared by multiple organizations. Built and operated for specific targeted groups that have same requirements. 
	NHS or Government use this type of Cloud.
	This provides a segregated approach for increased security. 
	This can be located on and off premises. 

On Premises - Provides greater control / Increases security. 
Off Premises - Lower cost, providing pay as you grow options, perceived as less secure.  


Pay As You Grow.
	Organizations pay for services that are required on an hourly basis in relation to the amount of resources used. 
	This does not require large upfront investment from companies. 


Chargeback.
	Accounting strategy that applies cost directly to the departments or teams that use resources. 

Multitenancy.
	Architecture that provides a single instance of an application to multiple clients (Tenants)
	Tenants are unaware of the other Tenants on the same application and ensures that they are unable to access or change other Tenants Data. 
	Typically used for SaaS.

Cloud Bursting
	Running and applicate on internal resources and "Bursting" to the public cloud on demand. "Short term way to increase your available cloud resources on demand"
	Recommended to high performance non critical and non sensitive data. Requires organization to consider security.
